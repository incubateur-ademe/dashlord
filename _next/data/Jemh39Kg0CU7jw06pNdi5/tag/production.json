Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nPinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use a non-immutable action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload. When selecting a SHA, you should verify it is from the action's repository and not a repository fork.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v44\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@c65cd883420fd2eb864698a825fc4162dd94482c # v44\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Using third-party

Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nPinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use a non-immutable action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload. When selecting a SHA, you should verify it is from the action's repository and not a repository fork.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v44\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@c65cd883420fd2eb864698a825fc4162dd94482c # v44\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Using third-party
