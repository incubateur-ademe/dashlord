Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload. When selecting a SHA, you should verify it is from the action's repository and not a repository fork.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v44\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: tj-actions/changed-files@c65cd883420fd2eb864698a825fc4162dd94482c # v44\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Using third-party actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.21.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:actions\",\"language\":\"actions\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:actions","state":"open","commit_sha":"6c21c54bd5ca672e6799154bab23ad72756b3693","message":{"text":"Unpinned 3rd party Action 'Deploy Sphinx Documentation to GitHub Pages' step Uses Step uses 'peaceiris/actions-gh-pages' with ref 'v4', not a pinned commit hash"},"location":{"path":".github/workflows/publish-docs.yml","start_line":41,"end_line":41,"start_column":13,"end_column":42},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/incubateur-ademe/quefairedemesobjets/code-scanning/alerts/44/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null}]}]}
