The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator.
