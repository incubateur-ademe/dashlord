The token may have write access to the repository, allowing an attacker to make changes to the repository.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe best practice to avoid code injection vulnerabilities in GitHub workflows is to set the untrusted input value of the expression to an intermediate environment variable and then use the environment variable using the native syntax of the shell/script interpreter (that is, not _${{ env.VAR }}_).\n\nIt is also recommended to limit the permissions of any tokens used by a workflow such as the GITHUB_TOKEN.\n\n## Example\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\nThe following example lets attackers inject an arbitrary shell command:\n\n```yaml\non: issue_comment\n\njobs:\n  echo-body:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - run: |\n          echo '${{ github.event.comment.body }}'\n```\n\nThe following example uses an environment variable, but **still allows the injection** because of the use of expression syntax:\n\n```yaml\non: issue_comment\n\njobs:\n  echo-body:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    -  env:\n        BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}\n      run: |\n        echo '${{ env.BODY }}'\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nThe following example uses shell syntax to read the environment variable and will prevent the attack:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  echo-body:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - env:\n          BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"$BODY\"\n```\n\nThe following example uses `process.env` to read environment variables within JavaScript code.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  echo-body:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: uses: actions/github-script@v4\n        env:\n          BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const { BODY } = process.env\n            ...\n```\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Security Lab Research: [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Untrusted input](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input).\n- GitHub Docs: [Security hardening for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions).\n- GitHub Docs: [Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.3"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:actions\",\"language\":\"actions\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:actions","state":"open","commit_sha":"97b20030825c6047a8832839e906a6e90585880a","message":{"text":"Potential code injection in ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}, which may be controlled by an external user."},"location":{"path":".github/workflows/cd-test-app-destroy.yml","start_line":29,"end_line":33,"start_column":9,"end_column":67},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/incubateur-ademe/territoires-en-transitions/code-scanning/alerts/99/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":98,"created_at":"2025-10-09T09:28:57Z","updated_at":"2025-10-09T09:28:57Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/incubateur-ademe/territoires-en-transitions/code-scanning/alerts/98","html_url":"https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/territoires-en-transitions/security/code-scanning/98","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"actions/unpinned-tag","severity":"warning","description":"Unpinned tag for a non-immutable Action in workflow","name":"actions/unpinned-tag","tags":["actions","external/cwe/cwe-829","security"],"full_description":"Using a tag for a non-immutable Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.","help":"## Overview\n\nUsing a tag for a 3rd party Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nPinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use a non-immutable action as an immutable release.
